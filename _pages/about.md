Minbo Ma is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Tsinghua University. He received dual Ph.D. degrees from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, and Fernuniversität in Hagen, Germany, was co-supervised by [Prof. Tianrui Li](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/litianrui/en/index.htm), Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Dr. h.c. Herwig Unger and Prof. Dr. Zhong Li. He also carried out a joint doctoral research program at Aalborg University, Denmark (Oct. 2022 – Oct. 2023), supervised by [Prof. Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/). He obtained his M.S. degree in Computer Science from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Fei Teng](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/tengfei/en/index.htm). 

His research focuses on interdisciplinary studies of artificial intelligence and spatio-temporal data mining, with applications in green energy, urban computing, and meteorology, as well as generative AI-based time series analysis.

He has published 10 high-quality papers as first author or co-author in prestigious international conferences and journals such as KDD, ICDE, TKDE, IJCAI, Information Fusion, Knowledge-Based Systems, and Information Sciences. His work includes one ESI Highly Cited/Hot Paper. He has won two third prizes in international data competitions. He also serves as a reviewer for leading international conferences and journals, including AAAI, ICDE, TKDE, PVLDB, CIKM, and TGRS.
